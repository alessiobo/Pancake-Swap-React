# Project Collaboration Guidelines
### This document outlines the guidelines for collaborating on the PancakeSwap website clone project. It is important that everyone involved in the project follows these guidelines in order to ensure a smooth and efficient collaboration process.

# Communication (poll needed)
Effective communication is key to the success of the project. The following communication channels will be used:

- Discord: for day-to-day communication, updates, and general discussion.
- GitHub: for project management, code reviews, and technical discussions.
- Trello: for ticket management and agile workflow with kanban system.

# Coding Standards
## The following coding standards must be followed:

1. Naming Conventions: Variable and function names should be descriptive and meaningful. Avoid using vague names like x or y. Use kebab-case for naming everything.

2. Formatting and Indentation: Consistent formatting and indentation makes code more readable and easier to understand. Use a consistent number of spaces or tabs for indentation, and keep code aligned to make it more readable.

3. Comments: Comments should be used to explain complex code logic or to provide additional context. Use comments to explain why you are doing something, not just what you are doing. However, comments should not be used to explain obvious or self-explanatory code.

4. Function Length: Functions should be short and focused. A good rule of thumb is to keep functions under 25 lines of code. If a function is too long, it should be broken down into smaller, more focused functions.

5. Consistent Style: Code should be written in a consistent style throughout the project. This includes naming conventions, formatting, and commenting. Using a consistent style makes the code easier to read and understand, especially when working with a team.

6. Version Control: Use a version control system like Git to manage changes to the code. Commit often and write informative commit messages. Use feature branches to keep changes separate and to facilitate code reviews.

Following coding standards like these can help ensure that the code is maintainable, easy to read, and free of errors. By adhering to these standards, you and your team can work more efficiently and effectively on the project.

# Conclusion
### By following these guidelines, we can ensure a successful and productive collaboration on the PancakeSwap website clone project. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to the project manager or other team members.
